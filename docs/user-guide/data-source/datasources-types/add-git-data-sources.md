# Add and Index Git Data Sources

Connect and index Git repositories as data sources.

Git repositories are one of the most powerful data sources in AI/Run CodeMie, enabling assistants to analyze code, understand repository structure, and work with your codebase directly. Git data sources index both source code and binary document types — including PDFs, MS Office files, and images — making them suitable for Talk-to-your-Data scenarios where a repository serves as a document store. This guide walks you through the process of adding and indexing Git repositories.

## Supported File Types

Git data sources index all text-based files and the following binary document formats:

| Format     | Extensions              | Processing method                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| PDF        | `.pdf`                  | Text extraction                         |
| Word       | `.docx`                 | Text and content extraction             |
| Excel      | `.xlsx`                 | Markdown tables                         |
| PowerPoint | `.pptx`                 | Text extraction                         |
| Email      | `.msg`, `.eml`          | Text and metadata extraction            |
| Images     | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg` | Semantic description via multimodal LLM |

All other files (source code, Markdown, JSON, YAML, plain text, etc.) are indexed as text.

:::info Image Indexing
Images are processed using an LLM vision model to extract semantic information. If no multimodal model is configured in the CodeMie instance, image files are skipped during indexing.
:::

:::tip Filtering document types
Use the **Files Filter** field to include or exclude specific formats. For example, to index only documents and skip code files: `*.pdf,*.docx,*.xlsx,*.pptx`
:::

## Prerequisites

:::info Git Integration
A Git integration is required only for **private repositories**. For **public repositories**, no integration is needed — AI/Run CodeMie verifies public access directly without credentials.
:::

Before adding a Git data source, ensure:

- For **private repositories**: a Git integration is configured (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). See [Integrations Guide](../../tools_integrations/integrations/index.md).
- The repository is accessible — either publicly available, or accessible via a configured integration.
- Appropriate permissions are in place to read the repository content.

## Adding a Git Data Source

To index a Git repository, fill in the following fields:

![Git Data Source Form](./add-git-data-sources/git-datasource-form.png)

### Configuration Fields

#### 4. Select Source Type

- Select Project: Select the name of the project with which you want to associate that DataSource.
- Name: Alias for file for quick search in datasource list.
- Description: Description for this datasource
- Choose Datasource Type: **Git** source type in the add new data source window.
- Choose Available indexing types:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="whole" label="Whole codebase" default>
    Direct indexing of raw code

    - **Best for**: Quick setup, simple code analysis
    - **Use when**: You want fast access to code without additional processing

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="per-file" label="Summarization per file">
    Generates summaries for each file

    - **Best for**: Documentation generation, code overview
    - **Use when**: You need high-level understanding of codebase

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="per-chunks" label="Summarization per chunks">
    Creates summaries for code chunks

    - **Best for**: Large codebases, detailed navigation
    - **Use when**: You need comprehensive code understanding
    - **Note**: Preferred mode, takes approximately 30-60 minutes

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Which Indexing Type Should I Choose?

- **Whole codebase**: Fast setup, ideal for small projects (< 500 files)
- **Per file**: Best for documentation and code overview
- **Per chunks**: Recommended for production use and large codebases
  :::

- Repository Link:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="github" label="GitHub" default>
    ```
    https://github.com/username/repository
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="gitlab" label="GitLab">
    ```
    https://gitlab.com/username/repository
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bitbucket" label="Bitbucket">
    ```
    https://bitbucket.org/username/repository
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

- Branch: Specify the target branch to work with.

:::warning Branch Selection
Always use stable branches (e.g., `main`, `master`, `develop`) for indexing. Feature branches may be deleted, breaking your data source.
:::

- Files Filter: Specify relevant file extensions to index in the field.

:::tip File Filter Behavior

**Filter behavior:**

- **Empty filter**: Include all files
- **Patterns** (e.g., `*.py`): Include ONLY matching files (whitelist)
- **!Patterns** (e.g., `!*.nupkg`): EXCLUDE matching files (blacklist)
- **Combined** (e.g., `*.py,!test_*.py`): Include .py files except test\_\*.py files

**Examples:**

- Python projects: `*.py` - Only Python files
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `*.js,*.ts,*.tsx,*.jsx` - Only JS/TS files
- Exclude binaries: `!*.nupkg,!*.dll,!*.exe` - Exclude package and binary files
- Java source only: `src/**/*.java` - Only Java files in src directory
- Python without tests: `*.py,!test_*.py,!*_test.py` - Python files excluding tests
- Documentation only: `*.md,*.rst,*.txt` - Only documentation files
- Documents only: `*.pdf,*.docx,*.xlsx,*.pptx` - Only MS Office and PDF files
- Code and documents: `*.py,*.pdf,*.docx` - Python files and documents
  :::

- Model Used for Embeddings: Select model Used for Embeddings.
- Select integration for Git: Choose the Git integration for repository access. This field is **optional for public repositories** — when left empty, AI/Run CodeMie verifies public accessibility directly. For private repositories, an integration is required.

#### 5. Configure Reindex Schedule (Optional)

In the **Reindex Type** section, configure automatic reindexing:

- **Scheduler**: Choose your preferred reindexing schedule
  - **No schedule (manual only)** - Default, requires manual reindexing
  - **Every hour** - For rapidly changing repositories
  - **Daily at midnight** - Recommended for most active repositories
  - **Weekly on Sunday at midnight** - For stable repositories
  - **Monthly on the 1st at midnight** - For rarely updated repositories
  - **Custom cron expression** - Enter custom cron expression (e.g., `0 9 * * MON-FRI`)

#### 6. Create Data Source

Click the **+ Create** button and wait for the process to finish.

:::info Indexing Time
Initial indexing may take 15-60 minutes depending on repository size. You can close the page - indexing continues in the background.
:::

**What happens next:**

1. AI/Run CodeMie validates the configuration
2. Connection to repository is established
3. Indexing process begins automatically
4. Progress can be monitored in the data source list

## Error Handling for Git Data Sources

Errors can occur in the following cases:

- **Invalid repository link**: URL format is incorrect or repository doesn't exist
- **Invalid token**: Git integration credentials are expired or incorrect
- **Incorrect branch link**: Specified branch doesn't exist in the repository

For all these cases, after the data source is added and automatic reindex is created, a general error with exit code (128) will appear:

![Git Error Example](./add-git-data-sources/git-error-example.png)

Now your Git repository is configured as a data source and ready to enhance your assistants with codebase knowledge.

### Common Error Messages

#### Exit Code 128

![Git Error Code](./add-git-data-sources/git-error-code.png)

**Cause**: General Git operation failure

**Common reasons:**

- Repository not found or inaccessible
- Authentication failed
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid branch name

**Solutions:**

1. Verify repository URL is correct
2. Check Git integration credentials are valid
3. Ensure branch name exists in the repository
4. Test repository access manually
5. Review integration permissions

#### Connection Timeout

**Cause**: Cannot establish connection to Git server

**Solutions:**

- Check network connectivity
- Verify Git server is accessible
- Review firewall settings
- Try again after a few minutes

#### Permission Denied

**Cause**: Insufficient access to repository

**Solutions:**

- Verify integration has read access to repository
- Check repository visibility settings (public/private)
- Update integration credentials
- Request access from repository owner

#### Repository Not Publicly Accessible

**Cause**: No integration was selected and the repository could not be accessed publicly.

**Solutions:**

- Verify the repository URL is correct
- Check that the repository visibility is set to **Public** on the Git hosting platform (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
- If the repository is private, select a Git integration in the data source form

## Using Git Data Source in Assistants

After successfully creating and indexing your Git data source, you can connect it to any assistant to provide access to your codebase.

### Adding Data Source to Assistant

1. Navigate to **Assistants** section
2. Click **+ Create Assistant** or edit an existing assistant
3. In the **Data Source Context** section, click the dropdown menu
4. Select your Git data source from the list
5. Save the assistant configuration

Now your assistant can access and analyze code from the indexed repository, enabling it to:

- Answer questions about code structure and implementation
- Explain functions, classes, and modules
- Suggest code improvements and refactoring
- Help with debugging and troubleshooting
- Provide codebase-specific recommendations

Your Git repository is now configured and ready to enhance your assistants with codebase knowledge.
