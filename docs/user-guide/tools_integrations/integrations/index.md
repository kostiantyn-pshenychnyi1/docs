# Integrations

There are three types of integrations, distinguished by scope and who can create them. If you don't explicitly select an integration, CodeMie picks one automatically — see [How the Default Integration Is Selected](#how-the-default-integration-is-selected) below.

- **User Integration**: Personal configuration scoped to the current project. Available only to you.
- **User Global Integration**: Personal integration with the **Global** toggle enabled. Available to you across all projects where you are onboarded.
- **Project Integration**: Shared configuration available to all project members. Requires the `isAdmin` or `applications_admin` role.

:::note
To create a **Project Integration**, you need the `isAdmin` or `applications_admin` role. To request `applications_admin` access, submit a Support ticket.

## How the Default Integration Is Selected

When a tool requires an integration and you haven't explicitly chosen one, CodeMie picks it automatically. **User Integration always takes priority over Project Integration.**

| Priority | Type                        | Created in                                               | Visible to                                        |
| -------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | **User Integration**        | **User** tab, current project                            | You only, in this project                         |
| 2        | **User Global Integration** | **User** tab, **Global** toggle enabled                  | You only, in all projects where you are onboarded |
| 3        | **Project Integration**     | **Project** tab (`isAdmin` or `applications_admin` only) | All project members                               |

If no matching integration is found at any level, the action requiring it will fail.

### When does this matter?

**One integration of a type** — it's always used automatically. Nothing to configure.

**Multiple integrations of the same type** — select the one you need when creating or editing an assistant. If you don't, the priority above applies.

### Tips

- Use **User Global Integration** if you use the same credentials across multiple projects — configure once, use everywhere.
- **Project Integration** acts as a shared fallback for team members who haven't set up their own.
- If a tool is using unexpected credentials, go to **Integrations → User** and check whether a User Integration is overriding the project-level one.

## Setting Up Integrations

1. In the AI/Run CodeMie main menu, click the **Integrations** tab:

   ![Integrations tab in main menu](./images/integrations-menu-sidebar.png)

2. In the Integrations menu, click **User** or **Project** and then click the **+ Create** button:

   ![Create integration button](./images/integrations-list-create-button.png)

3. Select the desired tool and specify the credentials and click **Save**:

   ![Integration creation form](./images/integration-create-form.png)

:::note
Most of the tools require you to specify the URL, token, and alias. Alias is the name of the setting that will be displayed in the integrations list.

## Alternative Ways to Create Integrations

As an alternative way of getting to the Integrations page, you can click the **Add User Integration** button in front of the desired tool when creating/editing your assistant:

![Add user integration from assistant page](./images/assistant-add-integration-button.png)

This link will also lead to the Create User Integration page. Note that this link appears only if no such tools are configured by the users.

If you have two or more integrations related to one tool, you can specify the needed one when adding/editing assistants:

![Selecting specific integration](./images/assistant-select-integration-dropdown.png)

## Creating Integration from Data Source Page

For Datasource you can create user integration from data source page:

1. Navigate or create a new datasource.

2. Click **Select integration** for.

3. Click the **Add User Integration** button.

   ![Add user integration button](./images/datasource-add-integration-button.png)
   ![Integration selection interface](./images/datasource-integration-modal.png)

4. After saving, the new integration appears in the existing list without requiring a page reload or navigation away.

## Filter Integrations

As you work with AI/Run CodeMie, the number of integrations will increase. To simplify navigation between integrations, use the filters. You can filter integrations by:

- **NAME**
- **PROJECT**
- **TYPE**
- **GLOBAL**
