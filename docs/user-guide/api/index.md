# Working with the CodeMie API

Below are the instructions for integrating with the CodeMie API/SDK. This guide demonstrates the process for authenticating and calling the API.

---

## Authentication Methods

There are two main ways to integrate with the CodeMie platform, depending on how you plan to use it:

### Client Password (User Credentials)

Use this method if you plan to work with the CodeMie SDK (Python, NodeJS). It relies on a specific user's credentials (username/password) and a configured Keycloak client.

[Learn more about User Password Access →](./user-password-access)

### Client Secret (Service Account)

Use this method for programmatic or backend access without relying on individual user credentials.

:::note
Enterprise customers supplied by scripts to create and manage User Password and Client Secret clients in Keycloak

## Making API Requests

Once you obtain a valid token (from either authentication method), include it in the `Authorization` header of your requests.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://codemie.example.com/code-assistant-api/v1/assistants/05959338-06de-477d-9cc3-08369f858057/model" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>" \
  -d '{
    "text": "hi"
  }'
```

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "generated": "Hello! Welcome to CodeMie, your AI-powered SDLC assistant. 😊 How can I help you today?",
  "timeElapsed": 2.2828991413116455,
  "tokensUsed": null,
  "thoughts": [
    {
      "id": "105bd3e4-a861-495b-b817-847555651642",
      "parent_id": null,
      "metadata": {},
      "in_progress": false,
      "input_text": "",
      "message": "Hello! Welcome to CodeMie, your AI-powered SDLC assistant. 😊 How can I help you today?",
      "author_type": "Tool",
      "author_name": "Codemie Thoughts",
      "output_format": "text",
      "children": []
    }
  ],
  "taskId": null
}
```

## Using the API Example: Call Assistant

Once you have the JWT token, include it in the `Authorization` header of your API requests to interact with the CodeMie API/SDK.

### Endpoint

**POST** `/v1/assistants/{assistant_id}/model`

Call particular assistant for getting answers/tasks.

### Required Fields for Request Body

| Field                 | Type    | Required | Description                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **text**              | String  | Yes      | User's ask or question                                                                    |
| **stream**            | Boolean | No       | Whether to stream response by chunks or return entire answer                              |
| **llmModel**          | String  | No       | Can override LLM model for assistant. Default value is selected during assistant creation |
| **propagate_headers** | Boolean | No       | Forward custom `X-*` HTTP headers to MCP tool invocations for context propagation         |

### Example Request Body

```json
{
  "text": "hi",
  "llmModel": "gpt-4o",
  "stream": true
}
```

### Example with Header Propagation

When using assistants with MCP servers, you can propagate custom HTTP headers to enable context-aware tool invocations. This is useful for multi-tenant scenarios, request tracing, or passing user-specific context.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://codemie.example.com/code-assistant-api/v1/assistants/{assistant_id}/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: acme-corp" \
  -H "X-Correlation-ID: trace-123" \
  -H "X-User-Context: engineering-team" \
  -d '{
    "text": "List all deployments in production environment",
    "propagate_headers": true
  }'
```

**How it works:**

1. Custom `X-*` headers (`X-Tenant-ID`, `X-Correlation-ID`, `X-User-Context`) are included in the HTTP request
2. `propagate_headers: true` enables header forwarding to MCP servers
3. When the assistant calls MCP server tools, these headers are automatically passed along
4. The MCP server can use these headers for tenant isolation, tracing, or authorization

**Common use cases:**

- **Multi-tenancy**: Pass `X-Tenant-ID` to scope MCP tool responses to a specific tenant
- **Request tracing**: Use `X-Correlation-ID` to track requests across services
- **User context**: Forward `X-End-User-ID` or `X-User-Role` for access control

:::tip
For workflow executions, you can also enable header propagation:

```bash
POST /v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/executions
X-Tenant-ID: my-tenant

{
  "user_input": "Run deployment check",
  "propagate_headers": true
}
```

## Success Response

**Status code:** `200`

### Example: stream is false

```json
{
  "generated": "Hello! How can I assist you today?",
  "timeElapsed": 1.1063213348388672,
  "tokensUsed": null,
  "taskId": null
}
```

### Example: stream is true

When `stream: true`, the response is sent as Server-Sent Events (SSE). Each chunk is delivered incrementally until the complete response is assembled.
