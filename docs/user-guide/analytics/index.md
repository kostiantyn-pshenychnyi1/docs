# Analytics Dashboard

The Analytics Dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring and management of LLM usage, costs, and activity metrics across the CodeMie platform. Access real-time insights into token consumption, spending patterns, and system utilization with flexible filtering and dual visualization modes.

## Personal Spending Widget

The Personal Spending widget gives you a real-time view of your LLM budget consumption
without leaving the platform. It is located at the top of the **Settings → Profile** page.

![Personal Spending widget](./images/personal-spending-widget.png)

The widget displays:

| Field                 | Description                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Current Spending**  | Your total LLM spend to date in the current budget period (USD) |
| **Budget Reset Date** | The exact date and time when your budget counter resets         |
| **Time Until Reset**  | Days, hours, and minutes remaining until the next budget reset  |

A circular progress chart visualizes how much of your total budget has been consumed.
The chart fills as spending increases toward the configured limit.

:::tip
If the widget shows no data, your administrator has not configured a budget limit for your
account via LiteLLM. Contact your administrator to set up budget tracking.

- View statistics for **all projects** in the organization
- View statistics for **all users** using CodeMie
- Access complete platform-wide usage and cost metrics
- Monitor all assistants, workflows, tools, and integrations

### Project Admin

Project Admins have limited access to analytics data scoped to their managed projects:

- View statistics only for **projects where you are a Project Admin**

- Access project-level metrics for assistants and workflows

:::info
To view analytics for projects or other users, you need either Platform Admin or Project Admin

## AI Champions Leaderboard

The Analytics Dashboard includes an **AI Champions Leaderboard** tab that ranks users by
their overall AI platform engagement score. Scores are calculated across six dimensions —
from daily platform usage to CLI-based agentic engineering — and users are grouped into
tiers from Newcomer to Pioneer.

Platform admins can browse the full ranked leaderboard with filters and drill into individual
user profiles. Regular users can view their own score and tier.

See [AI Champions Leaderboard](./ai-champions-leaderboard.md) for the full overview.
